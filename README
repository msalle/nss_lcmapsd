This software is designed for GNU/Linux with glibc 2.1 or later.

Summary:      An NSS (System Databases and Name Service Switch) module using
              LCMAPS

Dependencies: libcurl

Description:  This module provides getpwnam functionality for grid-mapfile
	      entries, using LCMAPS to resolve the mapping. It uses the lcmaps
	      REST interface, see https://github.com/okoeroo/lcmaps-rest.
	      It can be configured using a configfile, default
	      ${sysconfdir}/nss_lcmapsd.conf
	      Currently understood options (with defaults):
		LCMAPSD_URL      http://localhost:8008/lcmaps/mapping/rest
		LCMAPSD_TIMEOUT	 4
	      To test functionality a standalone testtool is provided,
	      nss_lcmapsd_test, which expects a single argument, the name to be
	      looked up.
		
Notes:        For efficiency, add this module as last entry in
              /etc/nsswitch.conf, e.g.
	      ...
	      passwd: files lcmapsd
	      ...
              It is possible to exhaust a gridmapdir by doing multiple lookups
	      for different inputs. This module does not provide protection for
	      that.
